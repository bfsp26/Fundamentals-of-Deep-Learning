# Fundamentals of Deep Learning

## Description

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that relies on deep neural networks, and it is the root of modern AI. It is how computers identify objects in images, translate speech in real-time, generate artwork and music, and perform other tasks that would have been impossible just a few short years ago. Learn what neural networks are, how they work, and how to build and train them using popular deep-learning libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow. More importantly, learn how to bring the magic of neural networks to the next software project that you work on, and come away with numerous code samples to get those projects started.
